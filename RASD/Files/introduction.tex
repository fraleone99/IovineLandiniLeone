\subsection{Purpose} 
Agriculture has a key role in India's economy and covid-19 pandemic has highlighted the need of building a resilient food system.
This need is increased by the problems due to climate change that will impact everything from productivity to 
livelihoods across food and farm systems and is predicted to result in a 4\%-26\% loss in net farm income towards the end of the century.
In addition, according to Harvard Business Review, food demand is expected to increase between 59\% to 98\% by 2050.\\
For this reason policy makers, citizens, agronomists, and farmers should share data and information to achieve better results. 
\\\\
Telangana region is an extended and populous state of India, whose economy is mainly driven by agriculture. 
To address the described above problem, Telangana's government want to design, 
develop and demonstrate anticipatory governance models for food system using digital 
public goods and community-centric approaches to strengthen data-driven policy-making in the state.
\\\\
The application aims to enable the acquisition, communication and combination of data provided by Telangana policymakers, 
farmers and agronomists as:
\begin{itemize}
    \item meteorological forecasts
    \item farmers' production
    \item amount of used water
    \item soil humidity
    \item agronomists' report
\end{itemize}
\bigskip
The product will allow policymakers to identify farmers who are performing well and those who are performing badly. 
As the first ones will receive special incentives and will be asked to provide useful best practices to others. 
Furthermore, the application will provide information regarding the results of the farmers who received help.
\\\\
The product needs to provide farmers the ability to visualize data relevant to them based on their location and type of production. 
Farmers should be also able to insert in the system data about production and any problem they face. 
They should be allowed to request help suggestions by agronomists and create forums to discuss with agronomists or other farmers.
\\\\
The application will allow agronomists to insert the area they are responsible for, receive information about requests for help, 
and answer them. Agronomists need to know data about weather forecasts and the best performing farmers in the area; 
they also need to visualize and update daily plan visits of farms. At the end of each day the agronomist need to confirm the daily
schedule.

\subsection{Scope}
To represent the scope of the project we use the "The World and The Machine" model by M. Jackson. 
It contains the events which cannot be observed by the system ("The World"), 
those strictly related to the system ("The Machine"), and those in common between them.
