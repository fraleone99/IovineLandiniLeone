## Application Overview

Agriculture has a key role in India's economy and covid-19 pandemic has highlighted the need of building a resilient food system.

This need is increased by the problems due to climate change that will impact everything from productivity to livelihoods across food and farm systems and is predicted to result in a 4%-26% loss in net farm income towards the end of the century.
In addition, according to Harvard Business Review, food demand is expected to increase between 59% to 98% by 2050.

For this reason policy makers, citizens, agronomists, and farmers should share data and information to achieve better results. 

The application aims to enable the acquisition, communication and combination of data provided by Telangana policymakers, farmers and agronomists as:
* meteorological forecasts
* farmers' production
* amount of used water
* soil humidity
* agronomists' report
